This repository contains **everything completed as part of a Udemy course**:
ðŸ‘‰ [Course Certificate & Link](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-af2973d6-3393-4be0-adaa-ebd877714a38/)

The course lasted **40.5 hours** and I completed it in its entirety.

Below is a **summary of the course sections**.
Each section includes a **very detailed `README.md` file**, describing:

* What was implemented
* Step-by-step instructions
* Associated source code

This is a **microservices project** built with **Docker and Kubernetes**, which was eventually **deployed to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** in the final stages of the course.
