# Section 6: Externalizing Configuration in Spring Boot

## Overview

Externalizing configuration allows us to separate configuration values (e.g., URLs, API keys, feature flags) from code. This is critical for building flexible and environment-specific applications.

### Different Ways to Inject Properties from Configuration Files:

---

## 1. Using `@Value` Annotation

* Allows injecting single property values directly into fields.
* Example:

```java
@Value("${my.property}")
private String myProperty;
```

* Works well for a few simple values like `app.version` or `feature.enabled`.
* Limitation: When there are many properties or complex structures, this becomes cumbersome.
* Also, when multiple property files are present (e.g., multiple profiles), `@Value` alone won't decide which one to pick unless the active profile is correctly set.

---

## 2. Using `Environment` Object

* Inject `Environment` to programmatically access properties.

```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    public void printSomeProperty() {
        System.out.println(environment.getProperty("my.property"));
    }
}
```

* Can also access environment variables (e.g., `JAVA_HOME`).
* Useful when keys are dynamic or based on logic, like `getProperty("config." + name)`.
* Not ideal if you have many properties to read.

---

## 3. Using `@ConfigurationProperties`

* Binds groups of properties into POJOs or records.
* Supports complex types like maps and lists.
* Allows validation.
* Example YAML config:

```yaml
accounts:
  message: "Welcome to TrelaBank accounts related local APIs"
  contactDetails:
    name: "Marcin Trela Developer"
    email: "marcin.trela.dev@gmail.com"
  onCallSupport:
    - (123) 456-7890
    - (123) 523-7890
```

* Corresponding POJO:

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "accounts")
public record AccountsContactInfoDto(
    String message,
    Map<String, String> contactDetails,
    List<String> onCallSupport
) {}
```

* Enable configuration properties in the main class:

```java
@EnableConfigurationProperties(AccountsContactInfoDto.class)
public class AccountsApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AccountsApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

* Inject the properties bean and use it:

```java
private final AccountsContactInfoDto accountsContactInfoDto;

@GetMapping("/contact-info")
public ResponseEntity<AccountsContactInfoDto> getContactInfo() {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(accountsContactInfoDto);
}
```

---

## When to Use Which Approach? ‚Äî Practical Summary

| Approach                   | When to Use                                     | Best for                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `@Value`                   | 1-2 simple values                               | `app.version`, `feature.enabled`      |
| `Environment`              | Dynamic keys or logic-based retrieval           | e.g., `getProperty("config." + name)` |
| `@ConfigurationProperties` | Groups of related properties, lists, validation | mail server, database, `api.*`        |

---

## Managing Different Environments (dev/test/prod)

* Spring profiles allow activating different sets of properties.
* Example:

`application-dev.properties`:

```
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/dev-db
```

`application-prod.properties`:

```
db.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-server/prod-db
```

* To specify which profile to use, set the active profile in `application.properties` or via command line:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

---

## Using Profiles in YAML with Imports

* Profiles can be grouped and imported:

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "qa"
  build:
    version: "2.0"
  accounts:
    message: "Welcome to TrelaBank accounts related QA APIs"
    contactDetails:
      name: "Example QA Contact"
      email: "example.qa.contact@gmail.com"
    onCallSupport:
      - (123) 456-7890
      - (123) 523-7890
```

* Import multiple profile files:

```yaml
config:
  import:
    - "application_qa.yml"
    - "application_prod.yml"
```

* Activate profiles:

```yaml
profiles:
  active: 
    - "qa"
```

---

## Changing Configuration Without Rebuilding Docker Image

* Following 12-factor app principles, do not rebuild Docker images for each environment.
* Instead, override configuration at runtime with:

### 1. Command Line Arguments (CLI)

* Highest priority.
* Example:

```bash
java -jar accounts-service.jar --build.version="1.1" --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

* Can be simulated inside IDE by modifying run configuration.

---![img_2.png](img_2.png)

* Endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to TrelaBank accounts related prod APIs",
  "contactDetails": {
    "name": "Example prod Contact",
    "email": "example.prod.contact@gmail.com"
  },
  "onCallSupport": [
    "(123) 456-7890",
    "(123) 523-7890"
  ]
}
```
* Endpoint http://localhost:8080/api/build-info returns version `1.1`

---

### 2. JVM System Properties

* Passed as `-D` flags.

```bash
java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -Dbuild.version=1.1 -jar accounts-service.jar
```

* Can be simulated by setting VM options in IDE.

---![img_3.png](img_3.png)


---![img_5.png](img_5.png)

* Endpoint http://localhost:8080/api/build-info returns version `1.1`



### 3. Environment Variables

---![img_7.png](img_7.png)

* Endpoint  http://localhost:8080/api/build-info returns version from env variable (e.g., `1.8`)

---

## Precedence of Configuration Sources in Spring Boot

Spring Boot resolves property values by the following priority (highest first):

1. Command line arguments (e.g., `--build.version=1.1`)
2. JVM system properties (`-Dbuild.version=1.1`)
3. Environment variables (`BUILD_VERSION=1.1`)
4. `application.yml` or `application.properties` files
5. Default values in code

## Summary Table of Configuration Methods

| Method                          | How It's Set                   | When It's Available  | Who Uses It                    | Good For                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **JVM System Property**         | Passed to JVM with `-D`        | Before Spring starts | Developers, scripts            | JVM-level config (encoding, logging)  |
| **Command Line Argument (CLI)** | Passed directly to Spring Boot | At Spring startup    | Devs, Ops running app manually | Spring Boot-specific overrides        |
| **Environment Variable**        | Set in OS/container            | Before anything      | OS, Docker, CI/CD, Cloud       | Cloud-native and secrets-safe configs |

---

## Real-World Challenges for Cloud Native

* You often **do not** have direct control over app launch commands.
* In Docker and Kubernetes:

    * CMD or ENTRYPOINT is fixed in the image.
    * You cannot add CLI args easily unless deployment manifests specify them.
* Thus:

    * `--key=value` and `-Dkey=value` require control over Java launch.
    * Environment variables (`KEY=value`) work seamlessly in Docker/Kubernetes.

## üîê Externalized Configuration in Spring Boot ‚Äì Challenges and Solutions

### ‚ùå Limitations of Using Only Spring Boot (Env Vars, CLI Args)

Managing application configuration only via CLI args, JVM options, or environment variables is **not scalable nor secure** for real-world, multi-environment, microservice architectures.

| Problem                       | Why it's a problem                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùì No version control          | You can‚Äôt track who changed what, when                                            |
| üßç No audit trail             | Environment variables aren‚Äôt centrally logged                                     |
| üîì No access control          | Too many people can access secrets like passwords or tokens                       |
| üí• Risk of boot-time errors   | A single missing or mistyped value can break the app on startup                   |
| üß© No encryption              | Env vars are usually visible in system processes ‚Äì a potential security risk      |
| üîÅ Hard to update dynamically | Updating config typically requires restarting the application                     |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Chaos at scale             | Coordinating values across 10s or 100s of instances becomes error-prone and messy |

---

## ‚úÖ Better Alternatives

* **Spring Cloud Config Server** ‚Äì Centralized configuration server (e.g., Git-backed YAML files).
* **Vault** ‚Äì Secure storage for secrets, with access control and encryption.
* **Auditing via Git** ‚Äì Track changes, rollbacks, and who did what.
* **Hot reload support** ‚Äì Use `/actuator/refresh` and `@RefreshScope` to dynamically reload without restart.

---

## üåê Spring Cloud Config Server ‚Äì Git-based Setup

The configuration can be stored:

* Locally inside the config server project,
* In external files on the system,
* **Best practice**: in a **dedicated GitHub repo**.

---

## üîí Encrypting Sensitive Data in Git Config Files

To securely store sensitive values (like emails or passwords) in Git:

### 1. Set up the encryption key in your `config-server` `application.yml`:

```yaml
encrypt:
  key: "V-6hQYD?w0QgedUy"
```

### 2. Encrypt values using `/encrypt` endpoint:

**URL**: `http://localhost:8071/encrypt`
**Method**: `POST`
**Body**: Plain text (e.g., your email or password)

---![img_1.png](img_1.png)

### 3. Use the encrypted value in your config file, prefixed with `{cipher}`:

```yaml
accounts:
  contactDetails:
    email: "{cipher}7b5637712265bf86d5c9ac2a9241cd902fd51ba..."
```

Then, when you hit your endpoint:
**`http://localhost:8080/api/contact-info`**,
you‚Äôll receive the **decrypted** value in the response.

### 4. You can also decrypt manually using `/decrypt`:

**URL**: `http://localhost:8071/decrypt`
**Method**: `POST`

---![img_4.png](img_4.png)

> üîê **Security Note**: Your encryption key (`encrypt.key`) should never be hardcoded in the YAML file in production.
> Store it securely, e.g., in **Vault** or other secret management solutions.

---

## üîÑ Updating Configuration Without Restarting Services

Once your microservices are up and running, you might want to update some config values (e.g., in GitHub repo) **without restarting the services**.

Spring Boot provides an **Actuator endpoint** to help with that:

### üëâ `POST /actuator/refresh`

**URL**: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh`

When invoked, the service fetches **updated values** from the config server and applies them live (for `@RefreshScope` beans).

Example success response:

```json
[
  "config.client.version",
  "accounts.message"
]
```

---

Sure! Here‚Äôs your full **English version** of the note, cleaned up and structured, with image references clearly marked so you know where to insert each numbered image:

---

## ü§Ø But What If You Have 50 Instances?

Here‚Äôs the catch:
If you have **50 instances** of a service (e.g., running in Docker, Kubernetes, or on different servers), you‚Äôd need to send a manual `POST /actuator/refresh` request to **each one** individually.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Spring Cloud Bus to the Rescue

Spring Cloud Bus works using a **pub/sub (publish-subscribe)** model.
It means: one message is published, and **every subscriber** listening to that topic receives it.

So no matter **how many instances** of a microservice you have ‚Äî all of them will **receive the refresh message**, as long as they‚Äôre listening.

---

## üêá Setting Up RabbitMQ

To use Spring Cloud Bus, you need a **message broker** ‚Äî we‚Äôll use **RabbitMQ**.

Let‚Äôs pull and run the RabbitMQ container with the management UI using Docker:

```bash
docker pull rabbitmq:management-alpine
```

Then run it:

```bash
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management-alpine
```

You can access the RabbitMQ management interface at:
**[http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)**

Log in using:

* **Username**: `guest`
* **Password**: `guest`

---![img_6.png](img_6.png)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Adding Spring Cloud Bus to Your Services

To enable communication via RabbitMQ, add this dependency to **all your services** (clients + config server):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Then configure RabbitMQ in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
    username: guest
    password: guest
```

---

## üîÅ Triggering a Refresh via Bus

Now, when you change something in your remote Git configuration repo,
you don‚Äôt need to restart each service manually.

Instead, simply call:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/busrefresh
```

This **automatically sends a refresh event to all subscribed instances**.

Just make sure every microservice is connected to the same bus (i.e., the same RabbitMQ broker).

---

üìå **This solves the problem** of having to manually send a refresh to every instance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Can We Automate Even That?

Yes, with **GitHub Webhooks**, we can push configuration changes **automatically** to every microservice via Spring Cloud Bus.

---

## üß© Setting Up GitHub Webhooks with Spring Cloud Config Monitor

1. Add this dependency to the **Config Server**:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-monitor</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. This gives you a new endpoint:

   ```
   POST /monitor
   ```

GitHub can now send a POST request to `/monitor` whenever a config file changes.
This triggers `busrefresh`, which distributes the update across all instances.

---![img_9.png](img_9.png)


---

## üß† Problem: GitHub Can‚Äôt Call Localhost

GitHub **can‚Äôt call** something like `http://localhost:8080/monitor` directly ‚Äî it needs a **public URL**.

You can use:

* [Hookdeck](https://hookdeck.com/) ‚Äì used in many tutorials, but might not work as easily now.
* ‚úÖ **[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)** ‚Äì a reliable alternative.

With **Ngrok**, you map your local service to a public URL.

Example:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

Ngrok will generate a public URL like:

```
https://b482021a3511.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

So in GitHub webhook settings, use:

```
https://b482021a3511.ngrok-free.app/monitor
```

---![img_8.png](img_8.png)

---![img_10.png](img_10.png)

---

## ‚úÖ Result

Now, whenever you push a change to the config repo on GitHub:

* GitHub triggers a webhook ‚Üí `/monitor`
* `/monitor` triggers Spring Cloud Bus
* Spring Cloud Bus notifies **all subscribing microservices**
* Every instance gets updated **automatically**

---

Now we need to containerize our entire application.
The property:

```
import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8071/"
```

cannot use `localhost` inside containers because they run in an isolated network and have different hostnames.

Therefore, we add the following environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  # the spring.config.import property will be changed through env variable
  SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME: accounts
  SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT: configserver:http://configserver:8071
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: default
```

Besides that, we need to address another challenge:
We want the config server to always start before the services, so we need a way to check whether the container is alive and ready to work.
For this, we need to understand two new concepts: **liveness** and **readiness**.

* **Liveness** means that the container is running, but maybe the application inside is still starting up.
* In that case, we also need **readiness**.

If the config server has both liveness and readiness, then we should start other services after it is ready.
Spring Boot Actuator has endpoints to check liveness and readiness:

```
/actuator/health/liveness
/actuator/health/readiness
```

So, we add this to our config server‚Äôs application.yml:

```yaml
health:
  readiness-state:
    enabled: true
  liveness-state:
    enabled: true
  endpoint:
    health:
      probes:
        enabled: true
```

This enables the health, readiness, and liveness endpoints:
`http://localhost:8071/actuator/health/liveness`
`http://localhost:8071/actuator/health/readiness`

---

Next, in the docker-compose for configserver, we add:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: "curl --fail --silent localhost:8071/actuator/health | grep UP || exit 1"
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 10s
```

This means that if `--fail` happens, exit code 1 is returned; otherwise, if `grep` finds "UP", the exit code is 0.

`grep` stands for:
**Global Regular Expression Print** ‚Äî
which means: find and print lines of text that match a pattern
(e.g. contain a certain word or regex).

---

We also need to add in other services that they depend on the config server:

```yaml
depends_on:
  configserver:
    condition: service_healthy
```

And we must add RabbitMQ as well:

```yaml
rabbit:
  image: rabbitmq:3.12-management
  hostname: rabbitmq
  ports:
    - "5672:5672"
    - "15672:15672"
  healthcheck:
    test: rabbitmq-diagnostics check_port_connectivity
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 10
    start_period: 10s
```

---

Now let‚Äôs optimize our docker-compose to separate repeated configuration:

We create **common-config.yml** where we analyze the common/repeated configuration in docker-compose and move it there:

```yaml
# Separation of common configs from docker-compose
services:
  # All services
  network-deploy-service:
    networks:
      - trelabank
  # All services except rabbit
  microservice-base-config:
    extends:
      service: network-deploy-service
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 700m
    environment:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: default

  microservice-configserver-config:
    extends:
      service: microservice-base-config
    depends_on:
      configserver:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT: configserver:http://configserver:8071/
```

We then import this into our docker-compose.yml.

For example, instead of repeating networks in rabbit, we import it from common-config.yml:

```yaml
rabbit:
  image: rabbitmq:3.12-management
  hostname: rabbitmq
  ports:
    - "5672:5672"
    - "15672:15672"
  healthcheck:
    test: rabbitmq-diagnostics check_port_connectivity
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 10
    start_period: 10s
  extends:
    file: common-config.yml
    service: network-deploy-service
```

Similarly for other services ‚Äî the key is that `extends` defines which configurations are combined.
If we extend a service that itself extends others, we can chain multiple imports (like 3 in a row).

---

üëâ Your thought is correct:
*‚Äúusing common config increases complexity because you have to look into two files‚Äù* ‚Äî yes, that‚Äôs true. But sometimes it‚Äôs worth it when the project grows.

---

Now we need to build the images again because files changed, so we run:

```bash
mvn compile jib:dockerBuild
```

We already have the images built (see image below: ![img\_11.png](img_11.png)).

Now we want to push them to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker image push docker.io/treladev/accounts:s6
```

We can now run docker-compose and see how it works.

---

We can also create profiles for **prod** and **qa**:

![img\_12.png](img_12.png)

---

We need to actually change one thing, namely the profile:

For production:

```yaml
environment:
  SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT: configserver:http://configserver:8071/
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
```

For QA:

```yaml
environment:
  SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT: configserver:http://configserver:8071/
  SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: qa
```

Thanks to this, we create docker-compose setups for production, default, and QA and can use them in each environment as needed.
